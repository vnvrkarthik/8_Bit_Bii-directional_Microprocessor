# 8Bit_MicroProcessor
I designed an 8 bit Micro Processor with ALU, 4 internal registers, Control unit, and additionally an External memory of 16 Bytes in a mesh model for easy address identification and neat circuit to avoid unnecessary circuitry. The reference pdf file also have example OP-CODE instructions for this microprocessor. It took me 5 days.
